## 📌 Contribution Guidelines

To ensure a clean, consistent, and high-quality repository, please follow these rules:

### ✅ What You Can Contribute

- 📂 Solutions to problems from:
  - LeetCode
  - HackerRank
  - HackerEarth
  - Codeforces
  - CodeChef
  - AtCoder
  - Other recognized platforms
- 📘 README.md explanations for each problem
- 🐞 Fixes to existing solutions, typos, or formatting
- 📁 Organizing code in the proper directory structure

---

## 📁 Folder Structure Format

Organize solutions by:

**platform → topic → problem**

```

root/
├── platform/
│   └── topic/
│       └── problem-name/
│           ├── solution.ext
│           └── README.md

```

For example:

```

leetcode/
└── arrays/
└── two-sum/
├── solution.cpp
└── README.md

````

## 📝 Problem README Template

Each problem **must** include a `README.md` with:

```markdown
# Problem Name – Platform

## 🧩 Problem Statement (summary)

Brief summary of the problem or constraints.

## 💡 Approach

- Describe your logic and algorithm.
- Mention time and space complexity.

## 📜 Code Explanation

## 💻 Coding Guidelines

* Write **clean**, **readable**, and **well-commented** code.
* Support any programming language you’re comfortable with.
* Use the correct file extension (`.cpp`, `.py`, `.java`, etc.)
* Avoid plagiarism or AI-generated code dumps.
* Each solution should solve the problem **efficiently** and **correctly**.

## 🚀 Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`)
4. Add your code under the proper directory
5. Add a README.md in the same folder
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Added solution for XYZ"`)
7. Push to your fork (`git push origin feature-name`)
8. Open a **Pull Request** to `main` on the original repo

---

## 🙅 What Not to Do

* ❌ Don't dump random files in the root directory
* ❌ Don't submit code without a proper README
* ❌ Don't use auto-generated code without explanation
* ❌ Don't rename or restructure others’ folders
